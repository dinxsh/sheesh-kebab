Problem Statement 1
Problem Title
National-Scale Digital Public Infrastructure for Seamless Service Delivery
Background & Context
Across modern societies, critical public services such as healthcare (telemedicine,
patient records), agriculture (farmer support, supply chain), smart cities (utilities,
transportation), education, and welfare are increasingly delivered through digital
platforms. However, most existing systems have evolved independently, resulting in
fragmented architectures, duplicated data, inconsistent user experiences, and limited
scalability. As the number of users and services grows, these disconnected systems
struggle to meet performance, reliability, and interoperability requirements. There
is a pressing need for a unified digital public infrastructure that can act as a common
backbone for diverse services while remaining flexible enough to support regional,
linguistic, and functional diversity.
Detailed Problem Description
The challenge is to design a comprehensive digital infrastructure capable of supporting
multiple public services through a shared, modular, and scalable architecture, with special consideration for agricultural extension services, healthcare delivery networks, and
urban management systems. The proposed system should enable seamless integration of
new services, standardized data exchange between departments, and consistent user experiences across platforms. Rather than focusing on a single application, participants are
expected to think at the level of national-scale system design, addressing concerns such
as service orchestration, fault tolerance, performance under heavy load, and long-term
maintainability. The solution should demonstrate how such an infrastructure can evolve
over time while ensuring continuity of critical public services.
Objectives
Create a working prototype that demonstrates:
1. A core platform/service registry that allows different government services to register

and connect
2. At least 2-3 mock services (e.g., healthcare appointment booking, agricultural advisory
service, city complaint system) that work through your platform
3. A data exchange mechanism between services
4. A dashboard showing system health, user traffic, and service performance
5. Implementation of at least one scalability feature (load balancing, caching, etc.)
Expected Outcomes
• A functional backend system with APIs/services
• Frontend interfaces for different user types (citizen, government admin, service provider)
• Demonstration of how new services can be added to the platform
• Evidence of system handling concurrent users/simulated load
• Clear documentation of your architecture and APIs
Judging Criteria

Criterion Description
Technical
Implementation: • Working, runnable code with clear setup instructions
• Code quality, architecture, and use of appropriate
technologies
• Handling of scalability, security, and reliability concerns
System Design:
• Modularity and extensibility of your architecture
• Data flow and API design between components
• Error handling and fault tolerance mechanisms
Impact &
Practicality: • Relevance to healthcare, agriculture, and urban domains
• User experience and interface design
• Potential for real-world deployment
AI-Driven
Innovation
(Bonus):
• In recognition of the current AI-driven technological
landscape, any technically sound implementation or
feature leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine
Learning (ML), or data-driven intelligence to enhance
system performance, automation, adaptability, or
decision-making can be considered for additional bonus
points, provided it is relevant, efficient, and well-justified.
Target Stakeholders / End Users
Government bodies, system administrators, policymakers, citizens, healthcare providers,
agricultural communities, and urban residents.
Suggested Solution Approaches
Participants may explore cloud-native architectures, microservices, API-driven systems,
distributed databases, and platform engineering practices, with potential integration of
IoT for agriculture, telemedicine platforms, and smart city sensors.

Constraints & Considerations
Security, data protection, scalability, regional infrastructure limitations, and long-term
sustainability must be addressed, with special attention to rural connectivity for agriculture, health data privacy, and urban digital divides.
